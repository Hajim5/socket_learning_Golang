Socket Learning in Go Language

This repository contains my practice and implementation of socket programming using Go (Golang).
All Go source code in this project is directly based on and corresponds 1:1 with the original Python socket examples provided in the Full-Stack Service Networking course taught by Professor Lee Seongwon (소프트웨어융합대학, 소프트웨어융합학과), Kyung Hee University.

The goal of this project is to understand fundamental networking concepts, compare socket usage between Python and Go, and implement equivalent communication mechanisms using Go’s standard library.

📌 Objectives

-Reproduce Python socket examples using Go language.

-Understand basic and advanced socket communication patterns.

-Explore differences between Python and Go in network programming.

-Strengthen foundational knowledge of client–server networking.
